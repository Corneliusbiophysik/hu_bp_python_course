Table S3X. tRNA expression,,,
"Relative tRNA expression was reconstructed by equating the relative expression of each tRNA species to the relative frequency its coded base amino acid divided by the number of tRNA which code for the amino acid. Absolute tRNA expression was reconstructed by additionally considering the total M. genitalium RNA mass and the relative contributions of m, r, s, and tRNA to the total RNA mass. See Table S3AU for additional information.",,,
